# DevTools Dashboard - TODO & Status

## üéØ Current Status (May 26, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Completed Today**
- [x] Fixed Docker socket access issues in development environment
- [x] Implemented dynamic `DOCKER_GID` build argument support in Dockerfile
- [x] Updated docker-compose.yml with automatic Docker GID detection
- [x] Fixed pre-commit hook stash handling that was reverting staged changes
- [x] Enhanced DOCKER_SOCKET_ACCESS.md with comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: GitHub Actions was building production image without `DOCKER_GID=986` build argument
- [x] Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to include `build-args: DOCKER_GID=986`
- [x] All changes committed and pushed to trigger new deployment

### üéâ **RESOLVED!**
- **Production API now returns actual containers!** ‚úÖ
- **Fix Confirmed**: GitHub Actions build with `DOCKER_GID=986` successfully resolved the Docker socket access issue
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - API endpoint now returns container data instead of empty results

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### 1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Docker Socket Fix Working!**
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [x] New image built with correct Docker GID
- [x] Deployment completed successfully
- [x] **API endpoint now returns actual container data!** üéâ

### 2. ‚úÖ **VERIFIED - Fix Successful**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Container now has correct Docker group GID
# ‚úÖ API endpoint returns actual container data
curl http://your-server:3001/api/docker/containers
# ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Returns actual container data instead of {"containers":[],"count":0}
```

### 3. **~~If Still Not Working~~** ‚úÖ **WORKING NOW!**
- [ ] Manual rebuild and push with correct build args:
  ```bash
  docker build -f backend/.docker/Dockerfile --target=production --build-arg DOCKER_GID=986 -t harbor.patricklehmann.dev/dashboard/dashboard:latest backend/
  docker push harbor.patricklehmann.dev/dashboard/dashboard:latest
  docker service update --force dashboard_dashboard
  ```

### 4. **Build Modern Frontend Dashboard** üé®
- [x] **Create React + TypeScript frontend** with Vite build system
- [x] **Implement shadcn/ui component library** for modern, accessible UI components
- [x] **Setup Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling
- [x] **Design dashboard layout** with header and main content areas
- [x] **Create dashboard widgets**:
  - [x] Docker containers overview (cards, status indicators)
  - [x] Real-time container status display
  - [x] Stats overview cards
  - [ ] System metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
  - [ ] Service health status
  - [ ] Real-time logs viewer
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline status
  - [ ] Quick actions panel
- [x] **Add dark/light theme toggle** with manual toggle

- [x] **Setup API proxy** for development server
- [ ] **Implement data fetching** with React Query/TanStack Query for caching and real-time updates
- [ ] **Add sidebar navigation** for different dashboard sections

### 5. **Implement Authentication System** üîê
- [ ] **Backend authentication**:
  - [ ] JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
  - [ ] Simple user management (single admin user initially)
  - [ ] Protected API routes with middleware
  - [ ] Session management and logout
- [ ] **Frontend authentication**:
  - [ ] Login form with validation
  - [ ] Protected routes with React Router
  - [ ] Authentication context/state management
  - [ ] Automatic token refresh
  - [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] **Security features**:
  - [ ] Rate limiting on login attempts
  - [ ] CSRF protection
  - [ ] Secure cookie handling
  - [ ] Environment-based credentials (via Vault)

### 6. **Fix Deployment Pipeline Issues** (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Remove build section from docker-stack.yml** to eliminate "Ignoring unsupported options: build" warning
- [ ] **Fix registry digest access** - ensure Harbor registry authentication is working properly
- [ ] **Improve deployment wait logic** - add proper service convergence check that waits for rolling update completion
- [ ] **Add deployment verification** - check that new containers actually have correct Docker GID after deployment

---

## üêõ **Known Pipeline Issues**

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Issues**
- **Issue**: Build was missing `DOCKER_GID` build argument
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Added to deploy.yml line 71-72
- **Impact**: Production containers couldn't access Docker socket

### 2. **Docker Group ID Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Base image uses GID 999 for `ping` group, conflicts with default Docker GID
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Dockerfile now handles existing groups gracefully
- **Solution**: `(getent group docker > /dev/null 2>&1 || addgroup -g $DOCKER_GID docker 2>/dev/null || addgroup docker)`

### 3. **Pre-commit Hook Problems**
- **Issue**: Git stash was reverting staged changes during validation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Improved stash handling logic
- **Solution**: Only stash if unstaged changes exist, use unique stash names

### 4. **Deployment Pipeline Issues**
- [ ] **Docker Stack Deploy Warnings**: 
  - **Issue**: `Ignoring unsupported options: build` - docker-stack.yml includes build section that's ignored in production
  - **Issue**: `image could not be accessed on a registry to record its digest` - Registry access/authentication problem
  - **Impact**: Nodes may run different image versions, inconsistent deployments
  - **Solution**: Remove build section from docker-stack.yml or use separate compose files for dev/prod
- [ ] **Rolling Update Wait Logic**: 
  - **Issue**: "Waiting for service to be ready" doesn't actually wait for rolling update to complete
  - **Impact**: Deployment reports success before containers are actually updated and healthy
  - **Solution**: Add proper service convergence check in deploy script
- [ ] **Cross-platform Docker GID**: Different systems may have different Docker group IDs
  - **Solution**: Environment detection script `scripts/get-docker-gid.sh`
  - **Status**: Created but may need integration with CI/CD
- [ ] **Vault Secrets**: Ensure all required environment variables are in Vault
- [ ] **Health Checks**: API health endpoint may need Docker connectivity validation

## üîß **Environment Configuration**

### **Development (Working)**
- Docker GID: Auto-detected via `${DOCKER_GID:-999}` in docker-compose.yml
- Socket mount: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`
- Status: ‚úÖ API returns actual containers

### **Production (‚úÖ WORKING)**
- Docker GID: Hardcoded `986` in docker-stack.yml and GitHub Actions
- Socket mount: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`
- Constraint: `node.role == manager` (required for Swarm API access)
- Status: ‚úÖ **WORKING** - API returns actual container data!

## üìã **Debugging Commands Reference**

### **Check Container Docker Access**
```bash
# Check Docker socket permissions
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=dashboard_dashboard | head -1) ls -la /var/run/docker.sock

# Check container user and groups
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=dashboard_dashboard | head -1) id

# Check Docker group in container
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=dashboard_dashboard | head -1) getent group docker

# Test Docker API access
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=dashboard_dashboard | head -1) curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/version
```

### **Check Service Status**
```bash
# Check service deployment status
docker service ps dashboard_dashboard --no-trunc

# Check service logs
docker service logs dashboard_dashboard

# Force service update (after image rebuild)
docker service update --force dashboard_dashboard
```

### **Check Host Docker Group**
```bash
# Check host Docker group ID
getent group docker

# Check running containers
docker ps | wc -l
```

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **When Everything Works**
1. **API Response**: `curl http://your-server:3001/api/docker/containers` returns actual container data
2. **Container Groups**: `getent group docker` shows `docker:x:986:backend` in production container
3. **Socket Access**: No permission denied errors in application logs
4. **Health Check**: `/api/infrastructure/health` shows Docker connectivity as healthy

### **Expected API Response**
```json
{
  "containers": [
    {
      "id": "abc123...",
      "name": "dashboard_dashboard.1.xyz",
      "image": "harbor.patricklehmann.dev/dashboard/dashboard:latest",
      "status": "running",
      "created": "2025-05-26T21:36:37Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 3
}
```

## üìù **Notes for Tomorrow**

1. **First Priority**: Check if the GitHub Actions deployment completed successfully
2. **Check Deployment Warnings**: The deployment shows concerning warnings about registry access and build options
3. **If API still returns 0**: The issue is likely that the old image is still cached or the service didn't update properly
4. **Manual Override**: Use the manual rebuild commands if automatic deployment doesn't work
5. **Fix Deployment Pipeline**: Address the registry digest and rolling update wait issues
6. **Documentation**: Update DOCKER_SOCKET_ACCESS.md with final resolution once confirmed working
7. **Testing**: Consider adding automated tests for Docker socket connectivity in CI/CD

### **Deployment Warnings to Investigate**
```
err: Ignoring unsupported options: build
err: image harbor.patricklehmann.dev/dashboard/dashboard:latest could not be accessed on a registry to record its digest
err: Each node will access harbor.patricklehmann.dev/dashboard/dashboard:latest independently, possibly leading to different nodes running different versions of the image.
```

These warnings suggest the deployment may not be working as expected, which could explain why the Docker socket fix isn't taking effect.
